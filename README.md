# Retail Sales Analysis using Python and Pandas

This project analyzes one month of retail sales data.  
It focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, and generating insights using Python and Pandas.  
This is my first complete data analysis project using Pandas.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- order_id  
- date  
- product  
- qty  
- price  
- customer_id

Additional columns created:
- amount (qty × price)  
- month (from date)

## Data Cleaning
Steps applied:
- Removed duplicates  
- Standardized product names  
- Filled missing values  
- Converted date column to datetime  
- Extracted month for trend analysis

## Analysis
Performed the following:
- Quantity and revenue per product  
- Number of orders per product  
- Top spending customers

- Customer lifetime value  
- Monthly revenue and order count

## Final Output
The summary includes:
- Total revenue  
- Total orders  
- Average order value  
- Best-selling and highest revenue products  
- Top customer  
- Repeat customer count  
- January performance metrics
